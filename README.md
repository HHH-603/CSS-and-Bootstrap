# CSS-and-Bootstrap

This is my professional developer portfolio, and the first website I created using Bootstrap.

I created this portfolio to showcase my biography, include several photos of myself with friends and family, and a contact page where people can provide their name, email, and a message for me to look at.

I used Bootstrap to style my HTML code because I wanted my webpage to be fully mobile response, so that anyone who reads it can easily do so from any device.

During this assignment, I learned a lot about the nuances of CSS that I hadn't been aware of previously. Specifically, I learned a lot about (1) cards, (2) margins, (3) text tags, and (4) wrapping text around/beside images within their respective cards.

I feel that the black/white color scheme I used, along with my mobile responsive hamburger menu, make my project stand out amongst those of my classmates.
